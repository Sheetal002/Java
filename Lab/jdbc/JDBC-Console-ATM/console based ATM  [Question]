Develop a console-based ATM application in Java that allows users to perform basic banking transactions such as deposits, withdrawals, and balance inquiries, using a JDBC connection to a MySQL database.
The application should have the following features:

1. Create an account with a unique account number and PIN code.
2. Check the account balance.
3. Make a deposit into the account.
4. Make a withdrawal from the account.
5. Exit the application.

Additionally, the application should enforce the following conditions:
1. The account number must be unique and cannot be duplicated.
2. The PIN code must have a minimum length of 4 characters and cannot contain spaces.
3. When checking the account balance, display the current balance.
4. When making a deposit, add the deposited amount to the current balance and display the updated balance.
5. When making a withdrawal, subtract the withdrawn amount from the current balance, and display the updated balance.
6. If the withdrawal amount is greater than the current balance, display an error message and do not perform the transaction.
